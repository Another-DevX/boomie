### Short description
P2P of USD/MXN remittances using GHO/XOC stablecoins and the MP platform.



### Description
This project seeks to solve the problem of remittances between the United States and Mexico (later Colombia and Latin America). We use a flow where we allow the exchange of USD/MXN using GHO/XOC stablecoins. Through decentralized P2P we seek to create a pool where users create orders and liquidity providers fill those orders. Verifications will be done using zk technology via email hashes.

### How it's made
For this project, we plan to use the ZKP2P technology to do the zero technology testing using the users' emails. Our smart contract written in Solidity will serve as a trunk to store the tokens. We will use JavaScript technology for backend and frontend integrations. All this will work through a flow that starts from the user when he creates a request through our ux, these orders will be taken to an order book where liquidity providers will fill them. Once the orders are approved by our zero knowledge tests using the ZKP2P tool, the funds are unlocked and can be withdrawn to fiat handling entities such as PayPal or MercadoPago.
